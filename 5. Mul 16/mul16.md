# Assembly Code Breakdown for 16-bit Multiplication

This document explains a MASM assembly code example that multiplies two 16-bit numbers and stores the result in memory.

## Assembly Code Breakdown  

### Assumptions  
```assembly
ASSUME CS:CODE, DS:DATA
```
- `ASSUME`: Tells the assembler which segments to associate with `CS` (Code Segment) and `DS` (Data Segment).
- `CS:CODE`: Associates the `CODE` segment with the `CS` register.
- `DS:DATA`: Associates the `DATA` segment with the `DS` register.

### Data Segment  
```assembly
DATA SEGMENT
    N1 DW 2222H
    N2 DW 4444H
    N3 DW 2 DUP(0)
DATA ENDS
```
- `N1 DW 2222H`: Defines `N1` as a 16-bit word containing `2222H`.
- `N2 DW 4444H`: Defines `N2` as a 16-bit word containing `4444H`.
- `N3 DW 2 DUP(0)`: Allocates space for the result, which is 32 bits (AX:DX).

### Code Segment  
```assembly
CODE SEGMENT
START:
    MOV AX, DATA
    MOV DS, AX
```
- `MOV AX, DATA`: Loads the starting address of the data segment into `AX`.
- `MOV DS, AX`: Transfers the address from `AX` to `DS`, setting up the data segment.

```assembly
    MOV AX, N1
    MOV BX, N2
    MUL BX
```
- `MOV AX, N1`: Loads `N1` into `AX`.
- `MOV BX, N2`: Loads `N2` into `BX`.
- `MUL BX`: Multiplies `AX` by `BX`. The result is stored in `DX:AX` (low 16 bits in `AX`, high 16 bits in `DX`).

```assembly
    MOV N3[0], AX
    MOV N3[2], DX
```
- Stores the lower 16 bits of the product in `N3[0]` (AX).
- Stores the upper 16 bits of the product in `N3[2]` (DX).

```assembly
    MOV AH, 4CH
    INT 21H
```
- Terminates the program.

```assembly
CODE ENDS
END START
```

## Memory Representation  

The memory dump shows how the multiplication result is stored in little-endian format.  

Since `N1 = 2222H` and `N2 = 4444H`, the multiplication produces:  
```
2222H * 4444H = 08E3_9758H
```
- Lower 16 bits (`9758H`) go into `N3[0]` (AX).
- Upper 16 bits (`08E3H`) go into `N3[2]` (DX).

In memory (little-endian):
```
N3[0] = 58 97
N3[2] = E3 08
```

## Output Explanation

### Assembly Execution Output
The program executes the multiplication operation and stores the result in memory. The output displayed during execution consists of:
- **Register values:** After execution, `AX` contains `9758H`, and `DX` contains `08E3H`.
- **Instruction flow:** The multiplication occurs at the `MUL BX` instruction, which affects both `AX` and `DX`.
- **Memory dump analysis:** The final memory representation confirms correct storage of the computed result.

### Debugger Memory Dump Analysis
The displayed memory dump reveals the stored values of `N3`:
```
076A:0000   22 22 44 44 08 E3 97 58
```
- `22 22` and `44 44` are the initial values of `N1` and `N2`.
- `08 E3 97 58` corresponds to the result `08E3_9758H` stored in memory in little-endian format.

This confirms that the multiplication has been performed correctly and the result is accurately stored in memory.
