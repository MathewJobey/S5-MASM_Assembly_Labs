# Assembly Code Breakdown for 16-bit Addition

This document explains a MASM assembly code example that adds two 16-bit numbers and handles an overflow using the carry flag. It also details how the resulting bytes are represented in memory.

## Assembly Code Breakdown
ASSUME CS:CODE,DS:DATA

ASSUME: Tells the assembler which segments to associate with CS (Code Segment) and DS (Data Segment).
CS:CODE: Associates the CODE segment with the CS register.
DS:DATA: Associates the DATA segment with the DS register.

DATA SEGMENT
N1 DW 4798H
N2 DW 0F186H
N3 DW 2 DUP(0)
DATA ENDS

DATA SEGMENT: Marks the beginning of the data segment.
N1 DW 4798H: Declares N1 as a 16-bit word with a hexadecimal value of 4798H.
N2 DW 0F186H: Declares N2 as a 16-bit word with a hexadecimal value of 0F186H.
N3 DW 2 DUP(0): Allocates two consecutive 16-bit words (initialized to 0) to store the result, including any carry.
DATA ENDS: Marks the end of the data segment.

CODE SEGMENT
START:
    MOV AX,DATA
    MOV DS,AX

CODE SEGMENT: Marks the beginning of the code segment.
START: Label indicating the starting point of the program.
MOV AX,DATA: Loads the starting address of the data segment into the AX register.
MOV DS,AX: Transfers the address from AX to DS, setting up the data segment.

  MOV AX,N1
    ADD AX,N2
    MOV N3,AX
MOV AX,N1: Loads the 16-bit value from N1 into the AX register.
ADD AX,N2: Adds the 16-bit value from N2 to the value in AX. If an overflow occurs, the carry flag is set.
MOV N3,AX: Stores the result of the addition from AX into N3.

JNC STOP
    MOV N3[2],01H
JNC STOP: Jumps to the STOP label if there is no carry (i.e., no overflow occurred).
MOV N3[2],01H: If the carry flag is set (indicating overflow), stores 01H in the next 16-bit word following N3 to indicate the overflow.

STOP: 
    MOV AH,04CH
    INT 21H
MOV AH,04CH: Loads the exit function code (04CH) for DOS interrupt 21H.
INT 21H: Executes DOS interrupt 21H to terminate the program.

CODE ENDS
END START
CODE ENDS: Marks the end of the code segment.
END START: Specifies the program entry point at the START label.

Memory Representation
The memory dump shows the bytes as IE 39 01 (assuming this is where the result N3 is stored).

Little-Endian Format:
The least significant byte is stored first. So, the memory stores the result as IE 39 01.
Conversion to Big-Endian (Readable Format)
When converted, IE 39 01 (little-endian) becomes 01 39 IEH in big-endian format.
Hexadecimal Representation and Bit Size
Each hexadecimal digit (0 to F) represents 4 bits (half a byte). Therefore:

Hex Digit	Binary Representation
0	0000
1	0001
F	1111
Explanation: Two hexadecimal digits together (such as IE, 39, or 01) represent 8 bits (1 byte).
Interpreting IE 39 01
IE (1 byte):
Represents 8 bits. For example, in binary it could be 11101110.
39 (1 byte):
Represents 8 bits. In binary, it is 00111001.
01 (1 byte):
Represents 8 bits. In binary, it is 00000001.
Each of these groups represents one complete byte (8 bits).
