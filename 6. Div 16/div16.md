# Assembly Code Breakdown for 16-bit Division

This document explains a MASM assembly code example that performs 16-bit division and stores the quotient and remainder in memory. It also interprets the output shown in the provided image.

## Assembly Code Breakdown

### Assumptions
```assembly
ASSUME CS:CODE, DS:DATA
```
- `ASSUME`: Informs the assembler which segments are associated with `CS` (Code Segment) and `DS` (Data Segment).
- `CS:CODE`: Links the `CODE` segment to the `CS` register.
- `DS:DATA`: Links the `DATA` segment to the `DS` register.

### Data Segment
```assembly
DATA SEGMENT
N1 DW 5555H
N2 DW 1111H
N3 DW 2 dup(0)
DATA ENDS
```
- `DATA SEGMENT`: Defines the data section of the program.
- `N1 DW 5555H`: Declares `N1` as a 16-bit word with a hexadecimal value of `5555H`.
- `N2 DW 1111H`: Declares `N2` as a 16-bit word with a hexadecimal value of `1111H`.
- `N3 DW 2 DUP(0)`: Allocates space for two 16-bit words initialized to `0` to store the quotient and remainder of the division.
- `DATA ENDS`: Marks the end of the data segment.

### Code Segment
```assembly
CODE SEGMENT
START:
    MOV AX,DATA
    MOV DS,AX
```
- `CODE SEGMENT`: Defines the start of the code section.
- `START`: Label marking the program entry point.
- `MOV AX, DATA`: Loads the data segment's starting address into `AX`.
- `MOV DS, AX`: Transfers the address from `AX` to `DS`, setting up the data segment.

```assembly
    MOV AX,N1
    MOV BX,N2

    DIV BX
```
- `MOV AX, N1`: Loads the 16-bit value of `N1` into the `AX` register.
- `MOV BX, N2`: Loads the 16-bit value of `N2` into the `BX` register.
- `DIV BX`: Divides `AX` by `BX`, storing the quotient in `AX` and the remainder in `DX`.

```assembly
    MOV N3[0],AX
    MOV N3[2],DX
```
- `MOV N3[0], AX`: Stores the quotient in `N3`.
- `MOV N3[2], DX`: Stores the remainder in `N3 + 2`.

```assembly
    MOV AH,04CH
    INT 21H
```
- `MOV AH, 04CH`: Loads DOS function `04CH` to terminate the program.
- `INT 21H`: Executes the interrupt to exit.

```assembly
CODE ENDS
END START
```
- `CODE ENDS`: Marks the end of the code section.
- `END START`: Specifies the entry point as `START`.

## Output Explanation

The output memory dump shows the result of the division:

1. **Calculation:**
   - `5555H` (21845 in decimal) รท `1111H` (4369 in decimal) = `05H` (5 in decimal) remainder `00H` (0 in decimal).
   - This means AX = `0005H` (quotient) and DX = `0000H` (remainder).

2. **Memory Representation:**
   - The quotient (`0005H`) is stored in `N3[0]`.
   - The remainder (`0000H`) is stored in `N3[2]`.

3. **Interpreting the Memory Dump:**
   - The memory contents match our expected results, confirming correct execution.

### Little-Endian Format
Since x86 architecture stores values in little-endian format, `0005H` is stored as `05 00`, and `0000H` remains `00 00`.
