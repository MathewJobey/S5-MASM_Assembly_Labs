# Assembly Code Breakdown for 32-bit Addition

This document explains a MASM assembly code example that adds two 32-bit numbers while handling overflow using the carry flag. Additionally, we will analyze the output from the debug session.

---

## Assembly Code Breakdown

### Assumptions
```assembly
ASSUME CS:CODE, DS:DATA
```
- `ASSUME`: Informs the assembler that `CS` (Code Segment) is associated with `CODE`, and `DS` (Data Segment) is associated with `DATA`.

### Data Segment
```assembly
DATA SEGMENT
N1 DD 8000FFFFH
N2 DD 80000001H
N3 DW 3 DUP(0)
DATA ENDS
```
- `DATA SEGMENT`: Marks the beginning of the data segment.
- `N1 DD 8000FFFFH`: Declares `N1` as a **double word (32-bit)** containing `8000FFFFH`.
- `N2 DD 80000001H`: Declares `N2` as a **double word (32-bit)** containing `80000001H`.
- `N3 DW 3 DUP(0)`: Allocates **three 16-bit words (totaling 48 bits)** to store the result and possible carry.
- `DATA ENDS`: Marks the end of the data segment.

### Code Segment
```assembly
CODE SEGMENT
START:
    MOV AX, DATA
    MOV DS, AX
```
- `MOV AX, DATA`: Loads the base address of the data segment into the `AX` register.
- `MOV DS, AX`: Transfers the data segment address to `DS` to set up memory access.

#### Step-by-Step Execution
```assembly
    MOV AX, WORD PTR N1[0]
    ADD AX, WORD PTR N2[0]
    MOV N3[0], AX
```
- `MOV AX, WORD PTR N1[0]`:
  - Loads the **lower 16 bits** of `N1` (`FFFFH`) into `AX`.
- `ADD AX, WORD PTR N2[0]`:
  - Adds the **lower 16 bits** of `N2` (`0001H`) to `AX`.
  - The result is `FFFFH + 0001H = 0000H` with a **carry of 1**.
- `MOV N3[0], AX`:
  - Stores the lower 16-bit result (`0000H`) in `N3[0]`.

```assembly
    MOV AX, WORD PTR N1[2]
    ADC AX, WORD PTR N2[2]
    MOV N3[2], AX
```
- `MOV AX, WORD PTR N1[2]`:
  - Loads the **upper 16 bits** of `N1` (`8000H`) into `AX`.
- `ADC AX, WORD PTR N2[2]`:
  - Adds the **upper 16 bits** of `N2` (`8000H`) plus the **carry flag (1)**.
  - The result is `8000H + 8000H + 1 = 0001H` with a **carry of 1**.
- `MOV N3[2], AX`:
  - Stores the upper 16-bit result (`0001H`) in `N3[2]`.

  ## Additional Explanation: `WORD PTR` and Bracketed Offsets

### `WORD PTR`
- **Purpose:**
  - The `WORD PTR` directive tells the assembler that the memory operand should be treated as a 16-bit (word-sized) value.
- **Why It's Needed:**
  - When accessing memory, the assembler needs to know the size of the data being referenced. Without this information, it might be ambiguous whether to treat the data as a byte (8 bits), a word (16 bits), or a dword (32 bits).
- **Example:**
  ```assembly
  MOV AX, WORD PTR N1[0]
  ```
  This instruction loads 16 bits from the memory location starting at `N1` into `AX`.

### The Number Inside the Brackets (e.g., `N3[4]`)
- **Purpose:**
  - The number inside the brackets specifies a **byte offset** from the start of the variable.
- **How It Works:**
  - If a variable is declared as a series of words (each word being 2 bytes), the offset number tells the assembler which word to access:
    - **`N3[0]`** accesses the first word (offset 0).
    - **`N3[2]`** accesses the second word (offset 2 bytes from the start).
    - **`N3[4]`** accesses the third word (offset 4 bytes from the start).
- **Example:**
  ```assembly
  MOV N3[4], 01H
  ```
  This instruction writes the value `01H` into the memory location that is 4 bytes from the beginning of `N3`, which corresponds to the third word.

---
```assembly
    JNC STOP  
    MOV N3[4], 01H
```
- `JNC STOP`: If there is **no carry**, jump to `STOP`.
- Since a **carry occurred**, `MOV N3[4], 01H` stores `01H` in `N3[4]` to indicate overflow.

```assembly
STOP:
    MOV AH, 04CH
    INT 21H
```
- `MOV AH, 04CH`: Loads the DOS terminate function.
- `INT 21H`: Calls DOS interrupt 21H to terminate the program.

## Understanding the Output

### Disassembly (`-u` output)
```
076B:0000  B86A07     MOV  AX,076A  
076B:0003  8ED8       MOV  DS,AX  
076B:0005  A10000     MOV  AX,[0000]  
076B:0008  03060000   ADD  AX,[0004]  
076B:000C  A30800     MOV  [0008],AX  
076B:0010  A10200     MOV  AX,[0002]  
076B:0013  130600     ADC  AX,[0006]  
076B:0016  A30A00     MOV  [000A],AX  
076B:0019  7306       JNB  0021  
076B:001B  C7060C000100  MOV  WORD PTR [000C],0001  
```
- The disassembly matches our expected instructions.
- `MOV`, `ADD`, `ADC`, and `MOV` operations match our breakdown.
- `JNB` (Jump if No Borrow, equivalent to `JNC`) correctly determines if the carry flag was set.
- `MOV WORD PTR [000C],0001` stores `1` in `N3[4]` to indicate an overflow occurred.

### Memory Dump (`-d` output)
```
076A:0000 FF FF 00 80 01 00 01 00 00 00  
```
- Breaking it down:
  - `FF FF 00 80` → **N1 (8000FFFFH)**
  - `01 00 01 80` → **N2 (80000001H)**
  - `00 00 01 00` → **N3 (00000001H) Result**
- Final result stored:
  - `N3[0] = 0000H`
  - `N3[2] = 0001H`
  - `N3[4] = 0001H` (overflow indicator)

### Final Computation Summary
```
   8000FFFFH  (N1)
+  80000001H  (N2)
--------------
   00010000H  (Result with Carry)
```
- Lower 16 bits: `FFFF + 0001 = 0000` (Carry `1`)
- Upper 16 bits: `8000 + 8000 + 1 = 0001` (Carry `1` stored in `N3[4]`)
- **Carry flag correctly handled!**

---

## Conclusion
- The assembly code successfully **adds two 32-bit numbers** and **handles carry propagation**.
- The debug output confirms correct execution.
- The result (`00010000H`) and **overflow indicator (`N3[4] = 1`)** match expectations.
