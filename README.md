## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Set up MASM and DOSBox**:  
   Follow this video tutorial to download and set up MASM in DOSBox:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [How to Download MASM and Mount it in DOSBox](https://youtu.be/12BUeTAQcKg?si=rfeCpwApQj7sKqKb)

2. **Place `.asm` Files**: 
   - ðŸ”´ **Ensure all `.asm` files are placed in the same folder** where you mounted MASM in DOSBox (e.g., `C:\Dbox`).  
   - This step is necessary for MASM and DOSBox to locate and assemble your files without errors.

3. **Common MASM Commands**:  
   Use the following commands to assemble, link, and execute your programs in MASM:

   ```bash
   mount c c:\<FolderPath>  # Mount the folder with MASM and .asm files
   c:                       # Switch to the mounted directory
   masm filename.asm        # Assemble the .asm file
   link filename.obj        # Link the object file
   debug filename.exe       # Debug the executable
   ```

   **Inside the debugger:**

   - `u` : View code  
   - `g` : Execute the program  
   - `d 076A:0` : Inspect memory (example)  
   - `q` : Quit the debugger
